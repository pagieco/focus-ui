# Display text

Display styles make a bold visual statement. Use them to create impact when the main goal is visual storytelling.
For example, use display text to convince or reassure users such as in marketing content or to capture attention during
onboarding.

## Best practices

- Use when the primary goal of the page is communication rather than interaction.
- Use larger display text sizes when a page is focussed around a single message. In these cases it may be paired with 
  an illustration.
- Use smaller display text to pari with larger text, or alone as part of more complex data displays such as dashboards.

## Content guidelines

### Display text

Display text should be:

- Benefits-driven and focussed on information that is most important to users.
- Concise and scannable:
  - Use simple, clear language that can be read at a glance
  - Keep display text content to a short sentence that's just a few words in length
  - Avoid using punctuation such as periods, commas, or semicolons
  - Avoid using exclamation marks. Display text already makes enough of a statement without an exclamation mark
  - Written in sentence case

## Accessibility

Altough display text creates an interesting visual experience, it doesn't replace the semantic structure provided by 
HTML headings.

By default, the display text component outputs text in an HTML paragraph (`<p>`). If a heading tag is needed for 
display text, use the `element` prop to set the heading level.
