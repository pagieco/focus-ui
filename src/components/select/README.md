# Select

Select lets users choose one option from an options menu. Consider select when you have 4 or more options, to avoid
cluttering the interface.

## Best practices

The select component should:

- Be used ffor selecting between 4 or more pre-defined options
- Have a default option selected whenever possible
- Use "Select" as a placeholder option only if there's no logical default option

## Content guidelines

### Select label

Labels should:

- Give a short description (1-3 words) of the requested input
- Be written in sentence case (the first word capitalized, the rest lowercase).
- Avoid punctuation and articles ("the", "an", "a")
- Be independent sentences. To support internationalization, they should not act as athe first part of a sentence that
  is finished by the component's options.
- Be descriptive, not instructional. If the selection needs more explanation, use help text below the field

### Select options

Options should:

- Start with "Select" as a placeholder if there isn;t a default option
- Be listed alphabetically or in another logical order so users can easily find the option they need
- Be written in sentence case (the first word capitalized, the rest lowercase) and avoid using commas or semicolons at
  the end of each option
- Be clearly labelled based on what the option will do
