# Popover

Popovers are small overlays that open on demand. They let users access additional content and actions without 
cluttering the page.

## Best practices

Popovers should:

- Always be positioned next to the button or other interface element that triggers them
- Be used for secondary or less important information and actions since they're hidden until the user hits the trigger
- Contain navigation or actions that share a relationship to each other
- Be triggered by a clearly labelled button.

## Content guidelines

If a popover contains actions, they should:

- Be clear and predictable: users should be able to anticipate what will happen when they click on an action item.
  Never deceive users by mislabeling an action.

## Examples

```vue
TODO
```

---

## Accessibility

Popovers usually contain a list of options or a list of actions, but can also contain other controls or content.
