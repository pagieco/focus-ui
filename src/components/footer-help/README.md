# Footer help

Footer help is used to refer users to more information related to the product of feature they're using.

## Best practices

Footer help should:

- Be positioned at the bottom of the interface
- Provide links to help that's related to the experience on the screen
- Not be used to promote features or provide explanation for how something works
- Never link to information designed to upsell to users
- In rare cases, link to blog posts when there isn't any help documentation to help users with the most logical next
  step in the workflow

## Content guideline

Links should be:

Clearly labeled: users shouldn't need to guess where they'll end up if they click on an action link. Never use
"click here" as a link because it doesn't set expectations about what's next.
