# Skeleton body text

Skeleton body text is used to provide a low fidelity representation of content before it appears on the page, and
improves load times perceived by users. CAn be used for content in or outside of a card.

## Best practices

Skeleton body text component should:

- Be used with the Skeleton Page component when page content loads all at once. Together, these components give users
  an indication of what the page layout will be once loaded.
- Be used on its own, inside any content container component, and when content loads after the main page load
- Try to match the number of lines to the content being loaded so it gives an accurate representation.

## Content guidelines

### Skeleton body text

Show static content that never changes on a page and use skeleton loading for dynamic content. Skeleton body text can
sometimes be used to represent non-typographic content such as forms. Don't use placeholder content that will change
when the page fully loads.
